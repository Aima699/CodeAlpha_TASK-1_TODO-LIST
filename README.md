# CodeAlpha_TASK-1_TODO-LIST
I have created a To-Do List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is designed with a user-friendly interface and includes features to add, delete, and filter tasks by their status (All, Active, Completed). Additionally, it incorporates basic animations to enhance the user experience.
